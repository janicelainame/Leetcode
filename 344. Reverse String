344. Reverse String
Python Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.



class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        start = 0
        end = -1
        for i in range(0, len(s)):
            if start < (len(s))//2:
                hold = s[start]
                s[start] = s[end]
                s[end] = hold
                start = start +1
                end = end -1
